# ArtificialEaselSDKX

## Description

A generative adversarial network (GAN)-based NFT art engine utilizing PyTorch and OpenCV, featuring a novel style-transfer algorithm for real-time AI-driven art curation and a decentralized metadata storage system for on-chain provenance.

## Features

- Here are 7 technical features for the ArtificialEaselSDKX software project:
- "Utilizes convolutional neural networks for realtime image processing and style transfer",
- "Supports multimodal input processing, including image, video, and 3D model data",
- "Provides an extensible plugin architecture for integrating custom AI models and algorithms",
- "Offers GPUaccelerated rendering for fast and efficient image generation",
- "Includes a builtin dataset management system for training and testing AI models",
- "Implements a robust error handling system with automatic rollback and retry mechanisms",
- "Features a webbased API for easy integration with external applications and services"
- Let me know if you need any modifications!
